So serval things about these program:
    1) if you want run files in Q8 folder, make sure put them out, else the system will crush
        beacuse there is no certain path in file IO, just the file name
   
    2) everytime the program run, the output file won't be overwritten, so you need to manaual delete
        the duplicate stuff
   
    3) the makefile is aimed to run question 8, but as i said early, you need to put out the files first.
